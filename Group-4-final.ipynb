Film is becoming more accessible and available at through subscriptions with monthly rates - rates which tend to remain static and similar across platforms despite varying amounts of available content to stream. Seeing as our team often use at least one of these streaming services for a large variety of different content in our free time, we thought it would not only be beneficial, but also informative and interesting to look into the details of the platforms we use. By exploring the data by platform, it allows us as a team to draw conclusions about which platforms may be the best invesment for different people depending on their taste in films and how much theyre able to get for their money from these subscription-based services which depart from the former rent-a-movie model that was prominent in the early 2000s.\n\n#### Questions for analysis:\n- Is there any review differences between IMBD reviews and Rotten Tomato ratings? If this difference exists, does it create a platform-wide disparity between review averages or are the IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomato ratings similar?\n- Which movie has the longest runtime and which has the shortest? Which platform is it available on? Does this platform have a lower average film runtime than the others?\n- Which movies has the most languages available (and which movies are those)?\n- Is there any correlation between the highest rated movies and the genre it is?\n- Taking into consideration the price of subscribing to streaming platforms, based on the amount of content available on the platforms available in the dataset, which would be the best choice in terms of different content offered?","metadata":{},"id":"8877432c"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analysis of the Data","metadata":{},"id":"2c3b892a"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Dataset Information","metadata":{},"id":"b79c118e"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Name: Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+\nLink: https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney\n\nWhat is it about?
